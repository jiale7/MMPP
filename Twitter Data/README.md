We explore multivariate Hidden Markov Chain models using real Twitter data. The script "Preprocess tweets.R" provides a method to preprocess Twitter text data into count data by applying a simple classification algorithm. 
In our model, each hidden chain represents a group of railway companies. We consider two scenarios: 
(1) two uncorrelated railway groups that do not share any routes, such as railway companies operating in the north versus the south of London; 
(2) two correlated railway groups that share some routes.
